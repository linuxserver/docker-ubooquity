  **IMPORTANT**
  Ubooquity has now been upgraded to [version 2](http://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/article19/ubooquity-2-1-0) and for existing v1.x users we recommend cleaning your appdata and reinstalling, due to changes in the application itself making the two versions essentially incompatible with each other. Also the admin page and library pages are now on separate ports as detailed below.

  Access the admin page at `http://<your-ip>:2203/ubooquity/admin` and set a password.

  Then you can access the webui at `http://<your-ip>:2202/ubooquity/`

  This container will automatically scan your files at startup.

  ### MAXMEM

  The quantity of memory allocated to Ubooquity depends on the hardware your are running it on. If this quantity is too small, you might sometime saturate it with when performing memory intensive operations. That’s when you get `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:` Java heap space errors.

  You can explicitly set the amount of memory Ubooquity is allowed to use (be careful to set a value lower than the actual physical memory of your hardware). Value is a number of megabytes ( put just a number, without MB )

  If no value is set it will default to 512MB.
